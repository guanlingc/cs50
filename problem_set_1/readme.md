# CS50 Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course. It demonstrates my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts and my ability to apply them in C.

## Problem Set 1

This problem set focuses on introductory C programming concepts, including loops, conditional statements, and basic algorithms.

*   **[cash](problem_set_1/cash/cash.c):** A program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user the correct change.
*   **[credit](problem_set_1/credit/credit.c):** A program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn's algorithm and identifies the card type (AMEX, MASTERCARD, VISA).
*   **[mario-less](problem_set_1/mario-less/mario.c):** A program that prints a left-aligned pyramid of hashes, similar to the blocks in Super Mario Bros., based on a user-specified height.
*   **[mario-more](problem_set_1/mario-more/mario.c):** A program that prints a double pyramid of hashes, separated by a gap, based on a user-specified height.
