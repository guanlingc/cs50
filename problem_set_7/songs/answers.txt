The audio aura by spotify is derived from 2 prominent
moods in the user's top songs and artists.
If audio aura was calculated from average energy, valence,
and danceability instead.
The user would be Orange and Blue due to the slight the higher rating on danceability and energy
however the middle range of valence suggest some level of neutrality.
The values might have skewed the way of the whole average. Perhaps getting counts like a histrogram to see
the distribution of how many songs fall into a high , mid and low of each category.
