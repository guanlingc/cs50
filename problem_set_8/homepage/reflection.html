        <h3>Why did i make the switch?</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Throughout the early stages of my career i was striving towards technical excellence,
            being resourceful to solve any problem that are being thrown my way. However, i would slowly realise that didnt
            seem to be enough, my peer were out-earning me.
            I was puzzled, we all have the same 24-hours, yet why am i falling behind. Later on, i realise that it was due
            to my skills not being valued.
            Thats why i decided to make a switch
        </p>

        <h3>Why AI of all other fields? </h3>
        <p class="text">
            With a decade worth of job experience, i realise that physical jobs are not sustainable as you get weaker every year.
            Therefore i wanted to look for something that was more officed based. With that i started reading up on different resources.
            Firstly, it was a RIASEC test, based on your personality they would tell you what nature of jobs would be most suited for you.
            It came down to eventually two fields, Data Science or CyberSecurity. CyberSecurity wasnt really what i wanted due to it being
            too technical and the things that they were doing were actually similar to what quality control is doing.
        </p>

        <h3>How has the journey been so far? </h3>
        <p class="text">
            Its been quite enlightening actually, i got to know a whole group of other people apart from the science world.
            Fresh Graduates whom i can share my working experience with, and in turn, learn about things from them.
            I know my gaps between myself and them and thats where i want to be able to move towards next.
            Althought there were alot of times where i felt i shouldn't have done this, there were also times where i feel like should have done it much earlier.
        </p>

        <h3>How is CS50 so far?</h3>
        <p class="text">
            It has been quite a revelation. Imagine being able to learn from someone who wants to teach? That didnt exist before, most the
            educators i met all just want to get it done and over with. I didn't feel the passion from them. Perhaps they were more suited
            for a life of doing their technical work.
            I loved the Fiftyville probelm especially, being able to put the skills to work in your own way. It really tests you because ultimately,
            you may have the ideas but you still need to be able to put them into codes and run them. That's where i am now.
